        A URL for a course page info from 選課系統大綱 will look something like this:
        http://courseap.itc.ntnu.edu.tw/acadmOpenCourse/SyllabusCtrl?year=103&term=2&courseCode=01UG025&courseGroup=&deptCode=GU&formS=&classes1=&deptGroup
        The first part(http://courseap.itc.ntnu.edu.tw/acadmOpenCourse/SyllabusCtrl) is the controller of course page info GET request
        , the second part seperated by the question mark is the actual GET request sent to that controller.
        You will find below the detailed description for each and every part of the GET request.

       year:
        學年.

       term:
        semester, '1' for the first and '2' for the second.

       courseCode:
        course code, same for the same course
        , 7 chars total, with first 3 chars being the department code(consult abbr column in department.sql)
        , the forth char being 'G' for general ed or a number(0~9) for others (? E for 教程 C for 碩班)
        , last 3 chars are all numbers(000~999).

       courseGroup:
        indicator for different offers of a single course
        , blank if course has only one offer
        , 1 char if course is offered differently depending on time or instructor
        , 1 char being a letter(A~Z).

       deptCode:
        department code, same for courses under same department
        , 2 chars for general ed and 4 chars for others total
        , 2 chars for general ed being 'GU'
        , 4 chars for others is random shits(consult code column department.sql db).
       
       *formS:
        The grade is course is intended for
        , blank for general ed or not restricted
        , a number(1~4) for every grade(大一 => 1, 大二 => 2, 大三 => 3, 大四 => 4).
       
       classes1:
        indicator for different offers for different classes of a single department of a single course
        , blank if course has only offer or for general ed
        , 1 char if course is offered to more that one class(班別)
        , 1 char being a number(0~9) whichs corresponds to 天干地支(甲乙丙...).

       deptGroup:
        department group for which course is intended
        , blank if department has only one group
        , a char if department is divided into more than one group
        , a char being a letter(A~Z)
        , currently only 美術系 is divided into 2 groups(A/B).

        p.s. 1: the combination is insurmountable if the approach is checking all possibilities(big O of n): 9999(code) * 27(course group) * 5(grade) * 12(class) * 27(dept group) = 437356260.
        Without changing the fundemental method(not changing the asymptotic size of the time of solution), I tried to optimize the solution by ignoring rare cases(such as course group of more than 5, class more than 2, or completely ignore dept group).
        There must be a better way, please tell me if you got one.

        p.s. 2: for unknown reason, there may be some warnings or errors when processing some page when converting them into xhtml.
        the warning may be a bunch of "Warning: simplexml_load_string(): ..."
        sometimes the warnings may be followed by a fatal: "Fatal error: Call to a member function registerXPathNamespace() on a non-object"
        I don't know the causes or the solution to both cases, please tell me if you know.
